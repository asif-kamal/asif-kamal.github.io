I created a Rails Application called LivingQuarters. It is an website that caters to hosts who would like other people to join them in small adventures around the globe. Many areas and points of interest are known only to few locals and so I wanted to build a portal for anybody seeking a way to discover new perspectives of living by participating in unheard of attractions.

I started out using 'rails app new' to flesh out the structure of my unbuilt app. Then I looked up online at projects similar to mine to get a grasp of how this project should look like. I spent quite a bit of time cloning other projects to see how everything related to everything else. I wanted to know how the controllers worked with the routes.rb file, etc, etc.

I had a general idea that I needed around 5 controllers, one for Hosts, for Sessions, and the list goes on. These controllers inculded all the code I needed for creating my views files. With a combination of form_fors and using prior knowledge on using instances of a Class to display data, my website started looking like it was coming together.

I had trouble with migrating databases because I kept having to change my attributes for my Attractions table. I also had to search far and wide for info that helped me drop old databases and seed files. Google was a good servant in this endeavor. One thing I learned is how I had to research about basic questions I had about ruby and rails online for myself. Even though much of what is taught to us on learn.co is enough, a lot of times looking for the answer for myself on Google was beneficial.

It's sort of like once you search for one answer, you are led to many other answers. Anyway I don't think I'll learn *all* of what is available about Rails in just a few weeks.

I messed about with the CSS for not too long, since I figured this is something I have studied about before in my UX Design course with CareerFoundry, and I should be able to repick it up when I have more time.

All in all my website functions pretty well, although there may be some glitchiness in it that can be finetuned still yet. It is not flashy but I think it fulfills the project requirements. I know this is all a work in progress and I hope I gain much experience throughout the whole of this course. 
Thank you!
