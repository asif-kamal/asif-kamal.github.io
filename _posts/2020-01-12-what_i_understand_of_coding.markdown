After 3 weeks of lessons I'm starting to see what the underlying psychological reasoning was in creating coding language. The algorithms and logic behind software engineering is designed to create such a well-defined structure in code that it can catch any situation and comprehend the problem and give the user a solution. It is completely left-brain and ignores right-brain understanding, which is intuitive. The intuitive capacity in a human being can see right through the problem in one glance. Many of society's ills are due to this problem of developing only the left-brain, which is used for calculation, at the loss of seeing the "big picture", which brings compassion and wisdom (right-brain). This is one of the reasons why even with such great scientific knowhow and new technologies human beings are still suffering violence, oppression, and general unkindness and ignorance. 

What good is software engineering if it doesn't serve the greater good of humanity, which includes you and I. This is a challenge for myself to bring change to field that has a lot of power to help our lives.
