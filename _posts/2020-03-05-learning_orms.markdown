I find ORMs interesting because they help make life easier in coding. Object Relational Mapping (ORM) uses what we learned earlier in Object Oriented Ruby and maps data through SQL. It follows the rule, DRY. Just another way of having what we write, as abstract as it may be, return to us almost every time the data we are looking for. 

One thing I find irritating about software engineering is we have this idea that, "we should think hard so we can not have to think/work later when we've built our code." There is a lack of awareness of the brittleness of code and how easily it can fail due to one simple error.
