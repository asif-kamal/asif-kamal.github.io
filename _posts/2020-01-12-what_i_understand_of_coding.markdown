After 3 weeks of lessons I'm starting to see what the underlying psychological reasoning was in creating coding language. The algorithms and logic behind software engineering are designed to create such a well-defined structure in code that it can catch any situation and comprehend the problem and give the user a solution. It is based in left-brain functioning and ignores right-brain understanding, which is intuitive. The intuitive capacity in a human being can see right through the problem in one glance. If we can bring both capacities to software engineering it can change our world for the better. A "bigger picture" understanding can allow us to focus on how to solve a central problem that will nullify all the symptoms. "Cutting to the root, instead of pruning the branches."
