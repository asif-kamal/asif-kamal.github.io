It has been a long time since I attended university, and so I've forgotten how we don't learn everything in one go. It takes time, going over all the information. I've decided to take it step by step and reread all the lessons relevant to bulding our sinatra portfolio project. I feel like looking over all the important lectures and lessons gives me a solid foundation to complete my project without fear of failure.
