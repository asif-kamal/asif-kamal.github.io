Learning about Ruby Concepts makes life easier with coding, not just because you can communicate with other coders but because once you understand why the command is named the way it is, it fits with the whole conception of its mechanism. For example an Object in Ruby has class and instances, and instance methods and so on. It helps when writing code to remember what needs to be done to run the code properly. I know when I took my first coding course in Python it seemed like a daunting task. There were so many things I didn't understand about coding (like why does it work this way?...). 
The reading in the lessons is very helpful because it tells us the overarching concept behind everything we code. It's basically learning how Ruby thinks. Which I like because once I know how Ruby thinks I can improve on how Ruby thinks :)
