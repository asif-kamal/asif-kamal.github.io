I've had experience with coding when I was younger. It was interesting and fun figuring out how to make the computer do things by typing in certain commands. My father has been in software development for almost all his career-life. To me I like knowing the logic behind computer programming languages, and this course will surely help me learn about it. It is also a very important technical field in today's world.
