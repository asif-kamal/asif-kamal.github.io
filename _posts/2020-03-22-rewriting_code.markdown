I've been on and off about learning coding, and recently I decided to look into the lessons more carefully. We get a ton of information, some of which is repetitive. So far throughout my coursework I've picked up on how we are being taught this stuff. First we learned basic ruby which set the ground for using this knowledge in new ways in order to apply in Sinatra or even Object-Orientation. I wish they showed us the grand scheme for coding in ruby. I feel like if, right off the bat we could be taught that all patterns of building programs follow the logic of explaining what we want to be done in more abstarct ways.

We started off building code that were the basics of getting Ruby to do something, such as putsing strings or creating arrays. Though these foundational lessons were helpful we weren't told about how a lot of work we are doing will become unnecessary when we are taught more abstract programming. This has been my major frustration, that I spend too much time doing something that later on is barely called upon.

I think many of the lessons could be shortened so we can focus more on coding that, as the expression goes, is used when "The rubber hits the road." This shortcoming of Flatiron school is unfortunate. 

Many times in my experience of life, as I'm sure all of us can attest to it, we learn concepts not by making sure we know everything before getting to the real work. We learn them just by doing something without knowing everything.
